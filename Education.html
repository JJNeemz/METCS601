    <p>I believe that is important to never stop learning and broadening your horizons. I began my post secondary education at The Ohio State University in the Mechanical Engineering college. After a couple semesters I realized that engineering was not for me, and changed my major to Security and Intelligence with a minor in Arabic. That led me to spend a year studying abroad in Kuwait to learn Arabic and the culture of the region. The following table outlines my education timeline: </p>

        <p>I was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. I graduated from <a href="https://www.osu.edu" target="_blank">The Ohio State University</a> in 2014 with a degree in Security and Intelligence. After spending a few years after college searching for a job as an intelligence analyst, I decided to join the Air Force. May 2016 I joined the Air Force and was assigned the job "Cyber Transport Technician," which is the equivalent of a network technician. This introduction into the IT field is what sparked my interest in learning web development and prompted my application to <a href="http://bu.edu" target="_blank">Boston University</a>.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include snowboarding, playing guitar, and playing video games. In my spare time I enjoy trying to teach myself programming languages and frameworks. I have taught myself Python 3 and some beginner level JavaScript coding. I would eventually like to use these skills to create a fully functional dynamic web page. I currently have CompTIA A+ and Security+ certifications which is necessary for my job in the Air Force. While I enjoy networking, I love programming and markup, as I get to create something from scratch which I can call my own.</p>
